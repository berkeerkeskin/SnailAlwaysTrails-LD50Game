Our game inspired by famous Immortal Snail Assassin hypothetical scenario.

As a player you try to avoid touching the snail while it chases you.<br />
You can throw objects to slow down the snail but not every object may not work as you wanted.<br />
The goal is avoid from snail as long as you can, every time you fail restart and try again for better score!<br />
